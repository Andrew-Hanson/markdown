Markdown is a formatting syntax used to type plain text. It is the simplest way to add formatting like headings, bold text, italic text, ordered and unordered lists, images, links, code segments, and so on, to plain text. Here are some of the MANY reasons to start typing in Markdown

    It boasts a key feature — the ability to use HTML. Tags like <br>, <h1>...</h1>, <p>...</p> etc can be used as you please in Markdown.
    It is SO EASY and SO PLEASING to read.
    It is everywhere. It is the default standard (unofficial) used on Github. Markdown is accepted on all sorts of websites, including Medium. Any content written in Markdown can be exported, without disturbing the formatting.
    It is not going away any time soon. After all, it is plain text format, which is here to stay.
    Using Markdown, you can harness the power of a word processor, without a word processor, using only your keyboard.

Markdown is a very big deal. How big of a deal is it to learn?

Markdown is nothing but using special characters for formatting. Have a look.
Headings:

The size of the heading is decided by the number of hash signs (#) before the text.

# Heading 1: Corresponds to the biggest size. It is the same as using <h1> in HTML.

## Heading 2: Corresponds to using <h2> in HTML.

### Heading 3: Corresponds to using <h3> in HTML.

… and so on till <h6>.
Paragraphs:

Markdown automatically detects a paragraph with every blank line. It is the same as using <p> in HTML.
Bold & Italics:

Simply enclose the text between double asterisk (**text**) or two underscores (__text__) to bold text. To italicise text, use single asterisks (*text*) or underscores (_text_) before and after the text.

I **love** _writing_ in __Markdown__.

The word ‘love’ and ‘Markdown’ will show up as bold. The word ‘writing’ will be italicised.

To combine, use three asterisks or three underscores (***text***) or (___text___). A combination of two asterisks and one underscore and vice versa can also be used (**_text_**).
Blockquotes:

To blockquote a paragraph, simply add > before the text. It is the equivalent of using the “ option in Medium.
Ordered Lists:

Use numbers followed by periods before each list item. This is the equivalent of using <ol>...</ol>, <li> elements in HTML.
Unordered Lists:

Use -, +, * before each list item. Add tabs for indenting nested lists, both ordered and unordered.
Code:

Enclose the code between backticks (`text`) to add in-line code. This is the equivalent of using <code>...</code> in HTML.

This is not all! The above is enough for you to get started. Check out more of the Markdown syntax here.

Markdown is that easy! Just a few special characters and you can format your plain text with ease. Remember to save your file with a .md extension.
